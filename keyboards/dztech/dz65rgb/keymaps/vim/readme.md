# vim-style layout

Focused on staying on the home row for productivity in a *nix environment.

Base Layer:
- `CAPS` --> `L_CTRL`
- `L_CTRL` --> `Fn`
- `Shift+Esc` --> `~`

Function Layer:
- Navigation:
    - `Fn + (H, J, K, L, I, N)` --> `(LEFT, DOWN, UP, RIGHT, HOME, END)`
    - `Fn + (DELETE, PgUp, PgDn)` --> `(INSERT, HOME, END)`
- Misc:
    - Audio: `Fn + (A, S, D)` --> `(Mute, Vol-, Vol+)`
    - Media: `Fn + (Z, X, C)` --> `(Prev, Play, Next)`
    - Mouse keys: `Fn + (R_SHIFT, R_CTRL)` --> `(MOUSE_CLICK_LEFT, MOUSE_CLICK_RIGHT)`
    - In case the binding `Shift+Esc` is ever required, do `Fn+Shift+Esc`. It basically can't be done comfortably on this layout, but it's there.
