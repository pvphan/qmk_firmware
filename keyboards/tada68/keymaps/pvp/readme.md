# vim-style tada68 layout

Minor tweaks to the default, focused on staying on the home row for productivity tasks.
Some navigation keys are duplicated in ways I've found intuitive.

Base Layer:
- `CAPS` --> `L_CTRL`
- `L_CTRL` --> `FN`
- `Shift + Esc` --> `~`

Function Layer:
- Audio: `FN + (A, S, D)` --> `(Mute, Vol-, Vol+)`
- Navigation: `FN + (H, J, K, L, I, N)` --> `(LEFT, DOWN, UP, RIGHT, HOME, END)`
- Right column: `FN + (DELETE, PgUp, PgDn)` --> `(INSERT, HOME, END)`
- Mouse keys: `FN + (R_SHIFT, R_CTRL)` --> `(left_click, right_click)`
- Gaming: `FN + WINDOWS` --> toggles disabling/enabling the windows key
